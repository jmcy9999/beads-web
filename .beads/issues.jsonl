OTEL/proxy reads active issue ID from this file.\n\n**Layer 4 — Git heuristics (complexity proxy)**: Lines changed per issue from git log between status transitions. Complements token data with \"output size\" metric.\n\n### Beads Already Supports This\n\n- `bd update \u003cid\u003e --metadata '{\"tokens\": N, \"cost_usd\": 0.05}'` — per-issue JSON metadata field (v0.49.2+)\n- `bd audit record` — append-only interaction logging to `.beads/interactions.jsonl`\n- `.beads/hooks/on_close` — lifecycle hooks for running aggregation scripts\n- Events export — mutation event stream for correlating status changes with time windows\n\n### Key Prerequisite: Validate ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL\n\nMust confirm Claude Code respects this env var for proxy routing. If not, OTEL becomes the sole exact-token path.\n\n### Story Points + Token Efficiency Formula\n\nOnce both story points (bw-6gw epic) and token tracking are in place:\n- `tokens_per_story_point = total_tokens / story_points`\n- `cost_per_story_point = total_cost_usd / story_points`\n- `developer_efficiency = story_points_closed / total_tokens` (across all issues)","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"janemckay@me.com","created_at":"2026-02-10T15:07:07.794431Z","created_by":"Jane McKay","updated_at":"2026-02-10T15:19:44.514812Z","labels":["chore"]}
