# Beads Web

**A browser-based dashboard for the [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) issue tracker.**

[![Next.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next.js-14-black)](https://nextjs.org/)

The first web frontend for Beads. Until now, interaction with Beads has been limited to the CLI (`bd`) and the terminal TUI (`bv` / beads_viewer). Beads Web gives teams visual, real-time access to their issue data -- dependencies, priorities, graph-based insights, and more -- through a dark-themed web UI.

## Features

### Core Issue Management

- **Dashboard** -- Sortable issue table with summary stats, quick status overview, and full-text search
- **Kanban Board** -- Issues grouped by status columns (Open, In Progress, Blocked, Closed)
- **Issue Detail** -- Full issue view with description, dependency tree, and metadata sidebar
- **Issue Actions** -- Start, close, reopen, and comment on issues directly from the UI

### Analysis & Insights

- **Insights** -- Interactive dependency graph with PageRank bottlenecks, keystone detection, HITS influencer/authority analysis, cycle detection, and graph density metrics
- **Time Travel** -- Git-based diff view showing issue changes since any ref (`HEAD~1`, `HEAD~5`, a branch name, etc.)
- **Token Usage Tracking** -- Per-issue and aggregate token/cost analytics for Claude Code agent sessions, with summary roll-ups across all repositories

### Pipeline & Agent Orchestration

- **Fleet** -- Pipeline kanban board for tracking epics through configurable project stages (e.g. research, development, review, submission). Epics are visualized as cards moving through pipeline columns, with per-epic cost tracking and agent status indicators.
- **Activity** -- Timeline view of agent sessions across all tracked issues, correlating token usage records with issue metadata
- **Agent Orchestration** -- Launch and stop Claude Code agents directly from the dashboard. Agents run as background subprocesses, with live status polling and log tailing. Pipeline labels are automatically managed when agents start and finish.
- **Signals Polling** -- Query endpoint for detecting issue state changes since a given timestamp, filterable by label and status. Useful for automation scripts and CI integrations that need to react to issue transitions.

### Multi-Repo & Navigation

- **Multi-Repo Support** -- Manage multiple Beads-enabled repositories from a single dashboard. Switch between repos or view all projects aggregated. Watch directories auto-discover new projects.
- **Settings** -- Add, remove, and switch between multiple Beads-enabled repositories. Configure watch directories for auto-discovery.
- **Filter Bar** -- Search, status, priority, and type multi-select filters across all views
- **Saved Views** -- 6 built-in presets (All Issues, Actionable, In Progress, Blocked, High Priority, Bugs) plus custom saved views
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** -- Single-key navigation throughout the app
- **First-Run Wizard** -- Guides new users through prerequisites check and adding their first repo
- **Error Boundary** -- Catches React errors with a retry option

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmcy9999/beads-web.git
cd beads-web
npm install
```

Set the path to a Beads-enabled project:

```bash
echo 'BEADS_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/your/beads-enabled-project' > .env.local
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| **Node.js 18+** | Runtime for Next.js |
| **Git** | Required for Time Travel diffs and Beads itself |
| **Beads CLI (`bd`) and beads_viewer (`bv`)** | Both installed automatically by `npm install` -- no separate or global install needed. `bd` is bundled as the `@beads/bd` npm dependency. `bv` is downloaded from GitHub releases by the `scripts/install-bv.sh` postinstall script. If the `bv` download fails (no internet, unsupported platform), the app falls back to SQLite-based analytics. At least one project must be initialized with `bd init`. The `BV_PATH` env var can override the `bv` binary path. |
| **Claude Code CLI** (optional) | Required only for agent orchestration features (Fleet, agent launch/stop). Install from [claude.ai](https://claude.ai). Not needed for core issue management. |

---

## Installation

### npm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmcy9999/beads-web.git
cd beads-web
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Docker

```bash
# Using docker compose with a specific project directory
PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/your/beads/project docker compose up

# Or build and run detached
PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/your/beads/project docker compose up -d
```

The container mounts your project directory as a read-only volume and serves on port 3000.

### Standalone Build

```bash
npm run build
node .next/standalone/server.js
```

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `BEADS_PROJECT_PATH` | Yes | Absolute path to a Beads-enabled repo (must contain a `.beads/` directory) |
| `BV_PATH` | No | Override path to the `bv` binary. If omitted, the version downloaded by the postinstall script is used. |

Set these in `.env.local` for development or pass them as environment variables in production.

### Multi-Repo Support

Beads Web can manage multiple Beads-enabled repositories. Configuration is stored in `~/.beads-web.json`.

- **Add repos** via the Settings page or the first-run wizard
- **Switch repos** using the sidebar dropdown or the Settings page
- **Aggregate mode**: Select "All Projects" to view issues from every configured repo in a single dashboard
- **Watch directories**: Configure parent directories to auto-discover new Beads-enabled projects
- **API-driven**: `POST /api/repos` to add/remove repos programmatically

## Architecture

Beads Web is a thin wrapper over the existing Beads data layer. It does not duplicate data or maintain its own database.

```
Browser  -->  Next.js API Routes  -->  bv CLI (Robot Protocol)
                                   |
                                   +->  SQLite fallback (.beads/beads.db)
                                   +->  JSONL fallback (.beads/issues.jsonl)
```

**Data flow:** The browser calls Next.js API routes. Each route shells out to `bv --robot-*` commands that return structured JSON. When `bv` is unavailable, the route reads directly from the Beads SQLite database via `better-sqlite3`. If the database is also missing, it parses `.beads/issues.jsonl` as a final fallback.

Responses are cached in memory with a short TTL to keep the UI responsive without hammering the filesystem.

## Deployment

### Docker

The included `Dockerfile` produces a minimal production image using Next.js standalone output tracing.

```bash
PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/your/beads/project docker compose up -d
```

### Netlify

A `netlify.toml` is included. Connect the repository to Netlify and it will build automatically using the `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` plugin.

> **Note:** SQLite-based features require a server runtime. Netlify deployments will depend on `bv` being accessible or the API routes being adapted for edge/serverless constraints.

### Standalone Node.js

```bash
npm run build
BEADS_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/project node .next/standalone/server.js
```
