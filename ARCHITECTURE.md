# Beads Web Architecture

> **Keep this document current.** Update it whenever features, data flows, APIs, or file structure change. Agents working on this codebase depend on it for context.

## What This Is

A Next.js 14 dark-themed web dashboard for the **Beads** git-backed issue tracker. It visualizes issues, dependencies, graph analytics, token usage, and project health across multiple beads-enabled repositories.

**Tech stack:** Next.js 14, React 18, TanStack React Query 5, ReactFlow 11, better-sqlite3, Tailwind CSS 3, TypeScript 5.

## Beads Data Model

### Storage

Each beads-enabled project has a `.beads/` directory containing:
- **`beads.db`** — SQLite database (source of truth). Tables: `issues`, `labels`, `dependencies`, `comments`, `events`, `config`, `metadata`, and others.
- **`issues.jsonl`** — JSON Lines export (one issue per line). Created by `bd sync`. May be stale — always prefer SQLite.
- **`token-usage.jsonl`** — JSON Lines with per-session token/cost records.

### Issue Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique ID with project prefix (e.g. `PatchCycle-9m2`, `beads-abc`) |
| `title` | string | Short summary |
| `description` | string? | Detailed description |
| `status` | string | See statuses below |
| `priority` | 0-4 | 0=critical, 1=high, 2=medium, 3=low, 4=backlog |
| `issue_type` | string | `bug`, `feature`, `task`, `epic`, `chore` |
| `owner` | string? | Assigned person/agent |
| `labels` | string[]? | Arbitrary tags. Dashboard uses `project:<name>` for multi-repo filtering |
| `story_points` | number? | Optional, not present in all beads DB versions |
| `dependencies` | array? | See dependencies below |
| `parent` | string? | Parent epic ID (from parent-child dependencies) |
| `created_at` | ISO timestamp | |
| `updated_at` | ISO timestamp | |
| `closed_at` | ISO timestamp? | Set when status becomes `closed` |
| `close_reason` | string? | Why it was closed |
| `created_by` | string? | Who created it |
| `notes` | string? | Research reports, extended notes. Optional, detected via PRAGMA |

### Statuses

| Status | Meaning | Dashboard Display |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| `open` | Ready to work | Green dot |
| `in_progress` | Actively being worked | Amber dot |
| `blocked` | Waiting on a dependency | Red dot |
| `deferred` | Postponed | Purple dot |
| `closed` | Done | Gray checkmark |
| `pinned` | Permanently visible | Blue pin |

### Dependencies

Stored in the `dependencies` table / `dependencies[]` array on each issue:

```json
{
  "issue_id": "app-123",       // this issue...
  "depends_on_id": "app-456",  // ...depends on this one
  "type": "blocks",            // or "parent-child" for epic membership
  "created_at": "...",
  "created_by": "..."
}
```

- **`blocks` type:** `depends_on_id` blocks `issue_id`. Issue can't proceed until dependency is resolved.
- **`parent-child` type:** `depends_on_id` is the parent epic, `issue_id` is a child task.

The dashboard computes two derived fields per issue:
- `blocked_by[]` — all issues this one depends on
- `blocks[]` — all issues that depend on this one

### Token Usage Records

Each line in `token-usage.jsonl`:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | ISO timestamp | When the session ended |
| `session_id` | string | Claude session ID |
| `issue_id` | string | Which beads issue this work was for |
| `project` | string | Project name |
| `model` | string | Model used (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`) |
| `input_tokens` | number | |
| `output_tokens` | number | |
| `cache_read_tokens` | number | |
| `cache_creation_tokens` | number | |
| `total_cost_usd` | number | |
| `duration_ms` | number | Session duration |
| `num_turns` | number | Agent turns in session |

### How the Dashboard Reads Beads

1. `sqlite-reader.ts` opens `.beads/beads.db` in readonly mode. Uses `PRAGMA table_info` to detect which columns exist (handles schema differences across beads versions).
2. If SQLite fails or DB is missing, falls back to parsing `.beads/issues.jsonl` line by line.
3. `bv-client.ts` tries the `bv` CLI first (richer graph analytics), falls back to the SQLite/JSONL path.
4. Issues are converted to `PlanIssue` objects with resolved dependency cross-references, epic associations, and `project:` labels.
5. API routes serve this data as JSON. React hooks poll every 30-60 seconds.

### Creating Beads for Different Workflows

Use the `bd` CLI to create issues. The dashboard will pick them up automatically.

**App builds:**
```bash
bd create --title="Build MyApp v1.0" --type=epic --priority=1
bd create --title="Set up Xcode project" --type=task --priority=1
bd create --title="Implement core UI" --type=feature --priority=1
bd create --title="Add CycleKit integration" --type=task --priority=2
bd dep add <ui-task> <setup-task>  # UI depends on project setup
```

**Research phases:**
```bash
bd create --title="Investigate auth approaches" --type=task --priority=2
bd create --title="Evaluate SwiftData vs CoreData" --type=task --priority=2
# Close with findings as the close_reason
bd close <id> --reason="SwiftData chosen - simpler API, sufficient for our needs"
```

**Kit enhancements (CycleKit, etc.):**
```bash
bd create --title="Add hormone level tracking to CycleKit" --type=feature --priority=2
bd create --title="Write tests for hormone tracking" --type=task --priority=2
bd dep add <tests-id> <feature-id>  # Tests depend on feature
```

**Bootstrap tasks (new project setup):**
```bash
bd create --title="Initialize project from template" --type=task --priority=1
bd create --title="Configure CI/CD" --type=chore --priority=2
bd create --title="Register with beads_web dashboard" --type=chore --priority=3
```

**Registering a new project with the dashboard:**
```bash
# From within the new project directory (must have .beads/ already):
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/repos \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "add", "path": "/absolute/path/to/project", "name": "MyApp"}'
```

Or add it directly to `~/.beads-web.json`:
```json
{
  "repos": [
    { "name": "MyApp", "path": "/absolute/path/to/project" }
  ]
}
```

## Features

### Issue Tracking Dashboard
- Full issue table with sort by 9 columns (id, project, title, status, priority, owner, epic, blockers, cost)
- Status summary cards (total, open, in_progress, blocked, closed)
- Highest-impact issue highlight ("What's Next")
- Recent activity feed (new/closed/modified/reopened from git diff)
- Mobile-responsive: table on desktop, card grid on mobile

### Kanban Board
- Columns by status: open, in_progress, blocked, closed
- Sorted by priority within each column
- Click-to-open slide-in detail panel with full issue info, dependencies, and **workflow action buttons**

### Graph Analytics (Insights)
- Bottlenecks (betweenness centrality) — issues that are gateway dependencies
- Keystones (critical path impact) — issues that transitively unblock the most work
- Influencers (eigenvector centrality) — most connected issues
- Hubs/Authorities (HITS algorithm) — issues that depend on many vs are depended on by many
- Dependency cycle detection (Tarjan's SCC)
- Graph density metric with color-coded badge
- Interactive dependency graph (ReactFlow) with status-colored nodes and cycle-highlighted edges

### Time Travel Diff
- Compare current issue state against any git ref (HEAD~1, HEAD~5, HEAD~10, HEAD~20, or custom)
- Shows new/closed/modified/reopened issue counts
- Field-level diffs (what changed on modified issues)
- Density delta and cycle change tracking

### Multi-Project Support
- Switch between beads-enabled repos via header dropdown
- "All Projects" aggregation mode merges issues across all repos
- Issues labeled with `project:<repoName>` for filtering
- Token usage aggregated across projects
- Config stored in `~/.beads-web.json`

### Filtering & Saved Views
- Filter by: status, priority, type, owner, labels, label prefix, project, epic, has blockers, is stale, is recent, search text
- Built-in views: All Issues, Actionable, In Progress, Blocked, High Priority, Bugs, **Submissions**
- **Submissions view:** Filters issues with `submission:*` labels (ready, in-review, approved, rejected)
- Save custom filter combinations as named views (localStorage)

### Research Report Display
- **API endpoint:** `GET /api/research/[appName]` reads markdown reports from factory repo at `apps/<appName>/research/report.md`
- **Multi-repo search:** Searches all configured repos for the report file, returns first match
- **Markdown rendering:** Uses `react-markdown` with `remark-gfm` for full GitHub-flavored markdown (tables, task lists, strikethrough, etc.)
- **Issue detail integration:** When viewing a `research`-labeled issue, the app name is derived from the parent epic title (e.g., "LensCycle: Market research" -> epic "LensCycle: Contact lens app" -> appName "LensCycle")
- **Styled for dark mode:** Custom Tailwind prose classes for dark theme rendering
- **Security:** App name validated against `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$` to prevent path traversal

### Token Usage Tracking
- Dashboard summary: total tokens, total cost, session count, total turns
- Per-issue detail: sessions table with model, tokens, cost, duration, turns
- Reads from `.beads/token-usage.jsonl`

### Cost Per App (Epic Cost Aggregation)
- **Fleet cards:** Each app card shows total cost with phase breakdown (research/development/submission/other)
- **Fleet page header:** Shows fleet-wide total cost across all apps
- **Issue detail page:** Epic-type issues show an "App Cost" section with total cost, session count, and per-phase cost bars with percentages
- **Phase classification:** Children's labels determine phase — `research` label = research, `development` label = development, `submission:*` labels = submission, anything else = other
- **Data flow:** Client-side aggregation — `useTokenUsageSummary()` provides per-issue costs, `computeEpicCosts()` in `fleet-utils.ts` maps children costs up to their parent epic
- **Phase ordering:** research → development → submission → other (pipeline order)

### Priority Intelligence
- Detects misaligned priorities (current vs recommended based on graph position)
- Shows confidence score and reason for each recommendation
- Up to 3 alerts on dashboard

### Issue Detail Page
- Full description, status, priority, owner, labels, type
- **Notes section:** Displays research reports and extended notes from `notes` field (only when non-empty)
- **Workflow action buttons:** Start Work (open), Close with reason (in_progress/blocked/deferred), Reopen (closed), Comment (adds comment to issue)
- **Factory research workflow:** When an issue has the `research` label, additional buttons appear: "Approve & Send to Development" (closes with approval reason) and "Request More Research" (adds a comment with feedback text). Available on both the issue detail page and kanban slide-in panel.
- Dependency tree: blocked by / unblocks (with titles resolved)
- **Epic children with progress:** For epic issues, lists all child issues with a progress bar showing completion percentage (closed/total)
- **Parent epic link:** For child issues, sidebar shows clickable link to parent epic
- **App Cost section:** For epic-type issues, shows aggregated cost across the epic and all children, with per-phase breakdown bars (research/development/submission/other)
- Token usage sessions table
- Timestamps (created, updated, closed) and close reason

### Epic Progress Bars
- **IssueCard (card variant):** Epic-type issues show a progress bar below the title (closed/total children)
- **IssueCard (row variant):** Epic column shows progress bar below the epic link
- **IssueDetailPanel:** Epic issues show a progress bar in the slide-in panel
- **Issue detail page:** Children section header shows "Children (X/Y — Z%)" with progress bar
- Progress computed from `allIssues` where `issue.epic === epicId`, counting `status === "closed"` as complete

### App Store Submission Tracking
- Uses existing label system: `submission:ready`, `submission:in-review`, `submission:approved`, `submission:rejected`
- **Colored badges:** IssueCard renders `submission:*` labels with colored badges (ready=blue, in-review=amber, approved=green, rejected=red)
- **Built-in "Submissions" view:** Filters for any issue with a `submission:*` label using the `labelPrefix` filter
- Factory agent labels issues via `bd label add <id> submission:ready` etc.

### App Fleet Dashboard
- **Pipeline view:** Epics displayed as "apps" in a factory pipeline kanban with 5 stages: Idea | Research | Development | Submission | Completed
- **Stage detection:** Automatic based on children's labels — `research` label = Research stage, `development` label = Development stage, `submission:*` labels = Submission stage, epic closed = Completed, default = Idea. Highest active stage wins; closed children are ignored.
- **Fleet cards:** Each app shows epic title, progress bar (closed/total children), priority, active/blocked task counts, submission status badges, and owner
- **Empty state:** Guidance on how to create epics and label children to use the fleet view
- **Navigation:** Sidebar link + keyboard shortcut `f`
- **Components:** `FleetBoard` -> `FleetColumn` -> `FleetCard`, with `fleet-utils.ts` for stage detection and fleet data extraction

### Research Completion Signals (Polling API)
- **`GET /api/signals`** — Polling endpoint for detecting issue state changes
- **Required param:** `since` (ISO timestamp) — returns issues changed after this time
- **Optional params:** `label` (filter by label, repeatable, AND logic), `status` (default "closed"), `field` (check "closed_at" or "updated_at")
- **Response:** `{ signals: [{ id, title, status, labels, closed_at, close_reason, epic, updated_at }], count, since }`
- **Factory use case:** Agent polls `GET /api/signals?since=<last-check>&label=research` to detect when research tasks close, then prompts Jane for review
- **Multi-repo:** Supports `__all__` aggregation mode — merges signals across all projects

### Auto-Registration (Watch Directories)
- **Watch directories:** Configure parent directories in Settings. The dashboard scans each for subdirectories containing `.beads/` and auto-registers new projects.
- **Auto-scan on load:** `GET /api/repos` automatically runs `scanWatchDirs()` on every call, so new projects appear as soon as you refresh.
- **Manual scan:** "Scan Now" button in Settings triggers an immediate scan and reports newly found projects.
- **API actions:** `POST /api/repos` supports `scan` (trigger scan) and `set-watch-dirs` (set watch directory list) actions.
- **Config:** `watchDirs` array stored in `~/.beads-web.json` alongside `repos` and `activeRepo`.
- **Factory use case:** Factory sets a watch directory (e.g., `~/dev/apps/`) and every new app project created by the factory auto-appears in the dashboard.

### Agent Activity Timeline
- **Visual timeline:** Sessions displayed as horizontal color-coded bars on a time axis, grouped by day
- **Day groups:** Each day shows a bar chart of sessions with time axis, plus a session list with issue links, duration, tokens, and cost
- **Color coding:** Sessions colored by issue phase — research (blue), development (amber), submission (purple), epic (green), other (cyan)
- **Tooltips:** Hovering over a timeline bar shows session details: issue, time range, duration, tokens, cost, turns, model
- **Summary stats:** Total sessions, duration, tokens, cost, and unique issues across the timeline
- **Fleet page:** Full timeline below the pipeline board, showing all agent activity across all issues
- **Issue detail page:** Per-issue timeline showing all sessions that worked on that specific issue
- **Data source:** `TokenUsageRecord[]` from `useTokenUsage()` — each record has `timestamp` (session end), `duration_ms` (used to compute start time), `session_id`, `issue_id`, `total_cost_usd`, token counts, and `model`
- **Utilities:** `timeline-utils.ts` provides pure functions: `buildTimelineEntries()`, `groupByDay()`, `formatDuration()`, `formatTokens()`, `computeBarPosition()`, `getEntryColor()`
- **Expandable:** Shows most recent 5-7 days by default with "Show more" to expand

### Agent Launch (Remote Claude Execution)
- **Generic API:** `GET /api/agent` returns current status; `POST /api/agent` with `action: "launch"` or `action: "stop"` manages a background Claude Code process
- **Backend:** `agent-launcher.ts` spawns `claude -p "<prompt>"` as a detached subprocess via `child_process.spawn()`, tracks PID, pipes output to log file
- **Safety:** Only one agent can run at a time. Repo path must be in `~/.beads-web.json` config. `CLAUDECODE` env var unset to avoid "nested session" error
- **Agent status:** Polls every 5 seconds via `useAgentStatus()`. Shows animated `AgentStatusBanner` on fleet page when running (model, elapsed time, PID, stop button)
- **Fleet integration:** Idea-stage app cards show a "Start Research" button. Clicking launches Claude in the factory repo with a research prompt. Button disabled while an agent is already running.
- **Hooks:** `useAgentLaunch()` (mutation), `useAgentStop()` (mutation), `useAgentStatus()` (polling query)
- **Launch params:** `repoPath`, `prompt`, `model` (default: sonnet), `maxTurns` (default: 200), `allowedTools` (default: common tools)
- **Process management:** Detached process (`child.unref()`) survives API restarts. Stop sends `SIGTERM` to process group. On exit, session state auto-clears.
- **Logs:** Written to `$TMPDIR/beads-web-agent-logs/agent-<repo>-<timestamp>.log`. Status endpoint returns last 2KB of log.

### System Health & Setup
- Health check: bv CLI availability, project path validity
- Setup wizard for first-time users (prerequisites check, add first repo)
- Keyboard shortcuts: d(ashboard), b(oard), f(leet), i(nsights), t(ime travel), s(ettings), /(search), ?(help)
- Live indicator with auto-polling (30s issues, 60s insights/tokens)

### Graceful Degradation
- Works without `bv` CLI installed (falls back to SQLite/JSONL for basic data)
- Schema-tolerant SQLite reader (handles different beads DB versions)
- Graph metrics computed locally when bv unavailable (approximate but functional)

**Fallback chain:** bv CLI -> SQLite DB -> JSONL file -> empty response. The app works without `bv` installed.

**Multi-repo aggregation:** When `activeRepo === "__all__"`, API routes fetch each repo's data in parallel directly from each project's `.beads/beads.db`, merge results, and add `project:<repoName>` labels for filtering. There is no hub or intermediary database — every read goes to the real project DB.

**Issue mutations:** The action route (`POST /api/issues/[id]/action`) uses `findRepoForIssue()` to resolve which project DB contains the issue, then runs `bd` in that project directory. This works in both single-project and `__all__` aggregation mode.

## Core Library Modules

### `src/lib/bv-client.ts` (central data layer)
Wraps `bv --robot-*` CLI commands via `execFile`. Normalizes PascalCase bv output to TypeScript types. 10-second TTL cache. Falls back to SQLite/JSONL when bv unavailable.

Key exports:
- `getPlan(projectPath?)` -> `RobotPlan`
- `getInsights(projectPath?)` -> `RobotInsights`
- `getPriority(projectPath?)` -> `RobotPriority`
- `getDiff(since, projectPath?)` -> `RobotDiff`
- `getIssueById(issueId, projectPath?)` -> `{ plan_issue, raw_issue }`
- `getAllProjectsPlan(repoPaths)` -> merged `RobotPlan` with `project:` labels
- `invalidateCache()` -> clears all cached responses

### `src/lib/sqlite-reader.ts`
Reads `.beads/beads.db` via `better-sqlite3` (readonly). Dynamically detects optional columns (e.g. `story_points`) via `PRAGMA table_info` to handle schema differences across beads versions. Returns `null` if DB missing (triggers JSONL fallback).

### `src/lib/jsonl-fallback.ts`
- `readIssuesFromJSONL(projectPath)` -> tries SQLite first, then `.beads/issues.jsonl`
- `issuesToPlan(issues, projectPath)` -> converts `BeadsIssue[]` to `RobotPlan` with dependency cross-references

### `src/lib/graph-metrics.ts`
Computes approximate graph metrics when bv unavailable: betweenness centrality (bottlenecks), transitive unblock count (keystones), degree centrality (hubs/authorities/influencers), Tarjan's SCC (cycles).

### `src/lib/repo-config.ts`
Manages `~/.beads-web.json`. `ALL_PROJECTS_SENTINEL = "__all__"` enables aggregation mode. Exports: `getActiveProjectPath()`, `getAllRepoPaths()`, `addRepo()`, `removeRepo()`, `setActiveRepo()`, `getRepos()`, `findRepoForIssue()`.

- **`findRepoForIssue(issueId)`** — Resolves which repo an issue belongs to by checking each configured repo's SQLite DB. Used by the action route to run `bd` in the correct project directory, even in `__all__` aggregation mode.

### `src/lib/recipes.ts`
Filter engine. `FilterCriteria` supports: statuses, priorities, types, owner, labels, labelPrefix, projects, epic, hasBlockers, isStale, isRecent, search text. Built-in views: All Issues, Actionable, In Progress, Blocked, High Priority, Bugs, Submissions. Custom views saved to localStorage.

### `src/lib/token-usage.ts`
Reads `.beads/token-usage.jsonl`. Provides raw records and per-issue aggregated summaries (tokens, cost, sessions, duration, turns).

### `src/lib/agent-launcher.ts`
Spawns Claude Code CLI as a detached background subprocess. Manages one active session at a time. Exports: `launchAgent(options)`, `getAgentStatus()`, `stopAgent()`. Types: `AgentSession`, `LaunchOptions`, `AgentStatus`.

### `src/lib/cache.ts`
Simple TTL cache (10-second default). Used by bv-client to avoid redundant subprocess calls.

### `src/lib/types.ts`
All TypeScript types:
- **Core:** `BeadsIssue`, `IssueDependency`, `IssueStatus`, `IssueType`, `Priority` (0-4)
- **Robot protocol:** `RobotPlan`, `RobotInsights`, `RobotPriority`, `RobotDiff`, `PlanIssue`, `PlanSummary`, `PlanTrack`
- **UI config:** `STATUS_CONFIG`, `PRIORITY_CONFIG`, `KANBAN_COLUMNS`
- **Token:** `TokenUsageRecord`, `IssueTokenSummary`

- **Filters:** `FilterBar`, `RecipeSelector`
- **UI primitives:** `StatusBadge`, `PriorityIndicator`, `IssueTypeIcon`, `SummaryCard`, `IssueCard` (row/card variants), `EmptyState`, `ErrorState`, `LoadingSkeleton`

## Multi-Repo Support

Config stored in `~/.beads-web.json`:
```json
{
  "repos": [
    { "name": "PatchCycle", "path": "/path/to/PatchCycle" },
    { "name": "beads_web", "path": "/path/to/beads_web" }
  ],
  "activeRepo": "/path/to/PatchCycle"  // or "__all__" for aggregation
}
```

- Header shows project selector dropdown when 2+ repos configured
- "All Projects" option sets `activeRepo` to `"__all__"`
- API routes detect `__all__` and aggregate across all repo paths
- Issues get `project:<repoName>` labels for filtering in the UI
- `useRepoMutation()` invalidates all data queries on project switch

## Design System

Dark mode with 4-tier surface palette:
- `surface-0` (#0f1117) -> `surface-3` (#2f323c)
- Status colors: open (green), progress (amber), blocked (red), closed (gray), deferred (purple), pinned (blue)
- Priority: critical (red), high (orange), medium (amber), low (green), minimal (gray)
- Font: Inter (UI), JetBrains Mono (monospace)
- Border: `border-default` (#353845)

## Important Patterns

1. **Schema tolerance:** SQLite reader checks which columns exist via `PRAGMA table_info` before querying. Different beads versions have different schemas (e.g. `story_points` is optional).
2. **Graceful degradation:** Every data path has a fallback chain. Never crashes on missing data.
3. **Security:** CLI calls use `execFile` (not `exec`). Diff `since` param validated against safe regex. Issue mutations go through `bd` CLI (validated issue ID + action). Mutations resolve the correct project via `findRepoForIssue()` so they always target the real project DB.
4. **Cache invalidation:** bv-client has 10s server TTL. React Query has 15s stale time + polling. Repo switch invalidates everything.

## Claude Code Hooks

Three global hooks installed at `~/.claude/hooks/` (canonical copies tracked in `scripts/hooks/`):

### `beads-collect-tokens.sh` (Stop hook)
Fires when a Claude Code session ends. Extracts token usage from the session transcript and writes a normalized record to `.beads/token-usage.jsonl`.

- **Token extraction:** Sums `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_read_input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens` from all assistant entries in the transcript JSONL.
- **Model:** Reads `.message.model` from the first non-synthetic assistant entry.
- **Cost calculation:** Multiplies token counts by model pricing (Opus: $15/$75/$1.875/$18.75 per M; Sonnet: $3/$15/$0.375/$3.75; Haiku: $0.80/$4/$0.10/$1).
- **Duration:** Computed from first to last timestamp in the transcript.
- **Turns:** Count of `user`-type entries in the transcript.
- **Issue attribution:** Looks up `issue_id` from `.beads/.session-map.jsonl` (keyed by `session_id`), falls back to `.beads/.current-issue`.
- **Deduplication:** If a record for the same `session_id` already exists, removes it before writing (the Stop hook can fire multiple times per session on resume/clear).

### `beads-session-start.sh` (SessionStart hook)
Fires when a Claude Code session starts or resumes. Detects beads-enabled projects (checks for `.beads/` directory), finds the active `in_progress` issue via `bd list`, and writes a session-to-issue mapping to `.beads/.session-map.jsonl`. Also sets OTEL environment variables.

### `beads-track-issue.sh` (PostToolUse hook)
Fires after Bash tool calls. Watches for `bd update <id> --status=in_progress` commands to track mid-session issue switches. Updates `.beads/.current-issue` and appends an `issue_switch` event to `.beads/.session-map.jsonl`.

### Data files written by hooks
| File | Written by | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `.beads/token-usage.jsonl` | collect-tokens | One record per session with token counts, cost, model, duration, turns |
| `.beads/.session-map.jsonl` | session-start, track-issue | Maps session_id to issue_id (session_start and issue_switch events) |
| `.beads/.current-issue` | session-start, track-issue | Current active issue ID (single line, used as fallback for attribution) |
